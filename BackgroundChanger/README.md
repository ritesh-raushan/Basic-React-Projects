# React Background Color Changer

This project is a simple React application that allows users to change the background color of the screen by clicking on different color buttons. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the current background color and provides an interactive way to explore different color schemes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the UI and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and layout design.

## How It Works

- The component uses the useState hook to store the current color.
- Each button has an onClick event handler that sets the background color state when clicked.
- The background color of the main div changes based on the selected color.
